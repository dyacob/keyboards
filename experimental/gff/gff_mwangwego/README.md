The GFF Experimental Mwangwego Keyboard
======================================

Copyright (C) Geʾez Frontier Foundation

This is an experimental keyboard for the Mwangwego script.  It requires the included “Mwangwego12” font 
which in turn encodes the script in the Unicode Private Use Area. See the typing manual for full details 
of the typing rules.

Caveats
-------
This is an *exerimental* keyboard that will not be compatible with a future standard for the Mwangwego
script. The font that the keyboard relies on, the  _Mwangwego_  font, uses a temporary encoding
space that would change under a final standard for the script. The implication is that documents composed with
this typeface will be incompatible with the anticipated international standard and will either need to be
recomposed on converted into the standard encoding.
